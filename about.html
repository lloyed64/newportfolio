    <div class="mystory">
      <p>
        As far as I know, during my childhood, I always had an affinity for drawing. As a child I never imagined myself becoming an artist when I grew up, but always admired great visual works of art and wanted to imitate it to the best of my abilities. At the start of college, I didn’t think about art as a long term career so I didn’t pursue it. However, as I started getting older my interest shifted so I swapped majors and decided to pursue art at the University of Arizona College of Fine Arts where I received my BFA in graphic design

      <br>
       After graduating I wanted to learn more about UX/UI design because I always been so curious about how good design can influence and direct people. I also
        found design to be important because it is very personable and it allows the designers to create something elegant and functional for the people. In 2019
       , I completed a nine-month mentorship focused on UI/UX design and Frontend Development. This program integrates on all aspects of UI/UX design and the foundation of Frontend Development.
