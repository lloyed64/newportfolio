         <h3>Case Study </h3>
          <p>There are several applications needed in order to connect and work with others effectively in today’s era.
             The current user experience currently jumps around from one application to another in order to finish tasks
             such as making documents, storing files, and communicating with others. Workflow wants to change it by giving
             users the accessibility to access all these features and more within the app making the user’s workflow more fluid. </p>
        </div>

       <section class="problem">
        <div class = "container">
         <h3>Problem </h3>
          <p>Students and Employed workers need to utilize several different apps in order to execute tasks within
             their daily work field. With today’s current market there wasn’t an app that provided features that enabled
             user’s to utilize a single app where users can store files, communicate with colleagues and friends,
             and work on projects together.</p>

       <section class="solution">
         <div class = "container">
         <h3>Solution </h3>
          <p>After all the testing that was conducted, I designed several prototypes with the idea to keep the app familiar
             to new users and create an app where users are able to stay and work in one platform. For this app, I wanted
             the main focus to be on communication so users and able to talk about different ideas as they are working on
             projects. The key features that I have added are voice and chat channels, project’s page that consists of
             having a document, sheets, and slides, and finally a storage page. Having access to all of these features
             in an app will enable user’s to work efficiently and effectively through their daily tasks.  </p>

         <h3>Survey </h3>
          <p>I created a user survey to see what types of storage and sharing application users were mostly using on a day
             by day basis. Based on the survey responses, some of the reasons people used their storage and sharing applications
             were: </p>

          <p> Around half of the people that have taken the survey claimed that they were students and the other half said they were employed for wages.
              The overall goals of the user surveys were to have the folowing:</p>
            <ul class = "survey-list">
              <li>Saving the content you find on the web.</li>
              <li>Organizing that content using things like categories, tags,groups, folders.</li>
             <li>Creating content</li>
             <li>Uploading files from the computer or mobile device. </li>

          <p>Differentiators between the three companies that I analyzed, utilized similar functionalities but approached them
             in different ways. To generate ideas for the product,  I wanted my targeted audience to be tailored towards students

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
         <p>I then began to create user personas where I made two different audiences. One of the personas is a student searching
            for a place to store files and be able to collaborate with multiple users while the other persona is an employee that hopes
            to find an app that will help with his productivity and have better communication flow with his co-workers.
            With those different perspectives, I then wrote user stories to rank the importance of what a new user might do on a
            website tailored towards students and employees.</p>

          <p>After researching and creating completed user stories, I sketched and then mocked up multiple user flows to show how the
            features would flow within the website. I then set up an open card sorting study in orrder to understand users' mental models of information architecture. These are some user flow examples and the sitmap.</p>

         <h3>Branding</h3>
          <p>This process helps companies understand and communicate consistent visuals and messaging to their
             audiences. The brand style guide helps define the Workflow’s brand elements and how they should be
             used across all marketing materials.  </p>

             <img src="images/type.png" alt="type">
             <p> Hind is Workflow's primary type family and should be used whenever possible to communicate keybrand messages in headlines.
                 Hind is accompanied by Open Sans for the use of reading long forms of text within Workflow.</p>
             <img src="images/logos.png" alt="logo">
             <p> When coming up with the color my approach was to design something simple and versatile. I wanted to highlight the icon’s
                 symmetry and how four separate pieces can be unified into one, creating a sense of collaboration.</p>
             <img src="images/color.png" alt="color">
             <p>With Workflow, collaboration being the main focus, I wanted the color pallete to represent a feeling of being focused and relaxed.
                To gather inspiration I assembled a moodboard of images and words that would represent being focused and being relaxed. With that I
                came up with multiple color palette samples and ended with a palette that has calm blues to eye catching orange and red. This color
                palette, along with our logo and typefaces, were then combined into a cohesive style guide. </p>

               prototypes, and preference testing. After gathering all the information I needed, I utilized material design throughout
               the design process of making the mobile app version. A key functionality of the mobile app version is the
               tab feature which allows users to easily move across the channel, storage, and projects page. </p>

             <p>With these mockups, I was able to create clickable prototypes that can be interacted with either mobile or desktop.
                By creating these prototypes, I was able to create usability testings where I tested two in-person and one remote
                usability tests. I tested users on different tasks and questions based on the functionality of the website.
                Every user that tested this website was able to complete the tasks given with ease. With the testing, I did get some
                feedback to make the website easier to use and applied them to my work afterward. </p>

         <h3>Conclusion </h3>
          <p>In my opinion, there are more features that I could’ve introduced in order to make a more fluid user experience.
             What works in my design is how the design is easy to navigate and people are able to identify the importance
             of features based on color. If I had more time I would have elaborated more by making mock-ups of the slides and
             sheets page. With this people can have a clearer idea of what the portion of the project of the app would look like
             instead of having just one example. </p>
