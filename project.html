         <h3>Case Study </h3>
          <p>There are several applications needed in order to connect and work with others effectively in today’s era.
             The current user experience currently jumps around from one application to another in order to finish tasks
             such as making documents, storing files, and communicating with others. Workflow wants to change it by giving
             users the accessibility to access all these features and more within the app making the user’s workflow more fluid. </p>

         <h3>Problem </h3>
          <p>Students and Employed workers need to utilize several different apps in order to execute tasks within
             their daily work field. With today’s current market there wasn’t an app that provided features that enabled
             user’s to utilize a single app where users can store files, communicate with colleagues and friends,
             and work on projects together.</p>

         <h3>Solution </h3>
          <p>After all the testing that was conducted, I designed several prototypes with the idea to keep the app familiar
             to new users and create an app where users are able to stay and work in one platform. For this app, I wanted
             the main focus to be on communication so users and able to talk about different ideas as they are working on
             projects. The key features that I have added are voice and chat channels, project’s page that consists of
             having a document, sheets, and slides, and finally a storage page. Having access to all of these features
             in an app will enable user’s to work efficiently and effectively through their daily tasks.  </p>

         <p>I then began to create user personas where I made two different audiences. One of the personas is a student searching
            for a place to store files and be able to collaborate with multiple users while the other persona is an employee that hopes
            to find an app that will help with his productivity and have better communication flow with his co-workers.
            With those different perspectives, I then wrote user stories to rank the importance of what a new user might do on a

With the Mobile version, I condensed the ideas of the desktop view onto the paper prototypes.

             <img src="images/logos.png" alt="logo">
             <p> When coming up with the color my approach was to design something simple and versatile. I wanted to highlight the icon’s

             <img src="images/color.png" alt="color">
             <p>With Workflow, collaboration being the main focus, I wanted the color pallete to represent a feeling of being focused and relaxed.
                To gather inspiration I assembled a moodboard of images and words that would represent being focused and being relaxed. With that I
                came up with multiple color palette samples and ended with a palette that has calm blues to eye catching orange and red. This color
                palette, along with our logo and typefaces, were then combined into a cohesive style guide. </p>

             <p>This is the High fidelity Mobile mockup for the app. A major problem that occured during the process of creating the mobile application was converting the desktop app into mobile. Translating several of the content from desktop to mobile did not translate as well as I thought. I also didn't utilize the material design guidelines.  Instead of reviewing the appropriate patterns  I used modals to manage each interaction. Not only were the  modals considered poor UX they are also outdated. Additionally, the typography was too small on many of the screens. How I solved this was utilizing the material design guidelines and using the tab interface where users are able to quickly swipe from one key feature to another. The modal issue was resolved by replacing them a with a pop up page essentially having the same content but not using modals. I also changed the layout of how the menu worked per feature. By implementing material design into my mobile high fidelity mockup the application will now feel fluid when users want to go into a different feature. </p>

             <p>With these mockups, I was able to create clickable prototypes that can be interacted with either mobile or desktop.
                By creating these prototypes, I was able to create usability testings where I tested two in-person and one remote
                usability tests. I tested users on different tasks and questions based on the functionality of the website.
                Every user that tested this website was able to complete the tasks given with ease. With the suggestions that
                were given from the usability testing I was able to identity small detail errors such as the circle plus
                icons on the bottom of the desktop application.

         <h3>Conclusion </h3>
          <p>In my opinion, there are more features that I could’ve introduced in order to make a more fluid user experience.
             What works in my design is how the design is easy to navigate and people are able to identify the importance
             of features based on color. If I had more time I would have elaborated more by making mock-ups of the slides and
             sheets page. With this people can have a clearer idea of what the portion of the project of the app would look like
             instead of having just one example. </p>
